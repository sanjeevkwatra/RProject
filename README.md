#  The comments are all self explanatory in the accmpanying R file
 # The last part was not finished. I was able to clean up the data, group by activity and subject, but do not know exactly to create a tidy set from here -- and there is no   time last. I jope the evaluator  will run my run_analysis.R

i have uploaded X.txt (the cleaned data set) to the git repository also. I  "attached" it when submitting the assigment on Coursera but it took >5 minutes to upload the file and the deadline expired during that time!!!! -- so am not sure if the file got attached. In case it is not, the same file can be got from github.
Thanks
